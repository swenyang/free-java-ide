the project is finished in a team of four, where i write the most parts except the edit area, communication area and multi-language support. the layout origins from the ttplayer, which is quite popular among Chinese users. window stuck function like winamp is also implemented. the file explorer is more complete however drag function is not supported yet. the ide still has a lot of bugs :P
